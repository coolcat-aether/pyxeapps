# README
Apps that buss, just like me.
As always, it's Python. But I've used PyInstaller to convert the Python file to an executable (.exe) file. 
I'll upload cool apps with bussy names. 

# Releases
Each release will have a different app. 
Release 1 has an app, while Release 2 has a different app. But if I upload Release 1.1, it'll be R1's app but with updates and bug fixes and new features.

# Apps
As I mentioned above, each release will have different apps. These apps include basic text editors (first release) to others which I'll upload when I can.
These apps are not just thought by me, but also OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini and others.
